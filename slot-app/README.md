### Netlify Configuration

This app is configured for Netlify deployment with the following settings:

- **Build Command**: `cd slot-app && npm run build`
- **Publish Directory**: `slot-app/build`
- **Build Settings**: Defined in `netlify.toml`

### Environment Variables

Set the following environment variables in your Netlify dashboard:

```
REACT_APP_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-id.supabase.co
REACT_APP_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key-here
```

### Supabase Setup

1. Create a new Supabase project
2. Create a `scores` table with the following schema:
   ```sql
   create table scores (
     id bigint generated by default as identity primary key,
     user_id uuid references auth.users not null,
     score integer not null,
     achieved_at timestamp with time zone not null,
     is_public boolean default true
   );
   ```
3. Enable Row Level Security (RLS) on the scores table
4. Add RLS policies for reading and writing scores

## Local Development

1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate to the slot-app directory: `cd slot-app`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`
4. Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and fill in your Supabase credentials
5. Start the development server: `npm start`

## Build

To build the app for production:

```bash
cd slot-app
npm run build
```

The build artifacts will be created in the `build/` directory.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
